      <h1> Steve Wolfe</h1>
      <h5>Known as <span>"Johnny Sins"</span></h5>
      <p>Sins was born Steven Wolfe in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on December 31, 1978.
         He has described himself as "very shy" while growing up. After graduating from the
         Indiana University of Pennsylvania, he got a job working six days a week in construction.
         He noticed the early signs of male pattern baldness when he was around 24 years old,
         and has kept his head shaved ever since. In 2006, at the age of 28, he quit his job
         and moved to Los Angeles to pursue on being a successful man.
